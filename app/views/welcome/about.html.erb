<h1>Tiffany in Connecticut</h1>

  <p>The <emphasis>Tiffany</emphasis> in Connecticut project was started by the
    Lyman Allyn Art Museum. After the acquisition of the Tiffany Window, "Come
    Unto Me", from All Souls Church, the museum set about creating an exhibit
    that explores the work of Tiffany within New London, Connecticut. More than
    a dozen sites relating to Tiffany and displaying the exceptional stained
    glass work of his studio were discovered by researchers within New London.
    These discoveries prompted an expansion of our efforts to include the greater
    state of Connecticut. </p>

  <p>By opening our data to the public, we hope to identify many more important sites
    with your help. If you know of a site or window, sign in or sign up using the

    site admin option so that you can add and maintain your site.</p>
